Relationship types
You share many relationships with members of your family. For instance, you and your mother are related. You have only one mother, but she may have several children. You and your siblings are related—you may have many brothers and sisters and, of course, they'll have many brothers and sisters as well. If you're married, both you and your spouse have a spouse—each other—but only one at a time. Database relationships are very similar in that they're associations between tables. There are three types of relationships:
One-to-one: Both tables can have only one record on either side of the relationship. Each primary key value relates to only one (or no) record in the related table. They're like spouses—you may or may not be married, but if you are, both you and your spouse have only one spouse. Most one-to-one relationships are forced by business rules and don't flow naturally from the data. In the absence of such a rule, you can usually combine both tables into one table without breaking any normalization rules.
One-to-many: The primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one, or many records in the related table. This relationship is similar to the one between you and a parent. You have only one mother, but your mother may have several children.
Many-to-many: Each record in both tables can relate to any number of records (or no records) in the other table. For instance, if you have several siblings, so do your siblings (have many siblings). Many-to-many relationships require a third table, known as an associate or linking table, because relational systems can't directly accommodate the relationship.
